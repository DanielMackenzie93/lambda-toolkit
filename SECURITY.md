# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We generally support the latest minor release of the project. Security fixes will be backported at our discretion.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please **do not** create a public issue for security vulnerabilities.
Instead, email the maintainers at **security@leighton.com** or use GitHub's private security advisories.
We'll acknowledge receipt within 2 business days and provide a timeline for a fix once triaged.

## Disclosure
After a fix is released, we'll credit reporters (if desired) in the release notes.
